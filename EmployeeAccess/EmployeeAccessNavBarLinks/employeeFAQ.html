        <strong>Q3: What about the company's future, and how will they better treat workers?</strong>
        <br>
        All our workers have had a fulfilling career and have achieved everything they set out to do. As a company we
        strive to do more than our workers, and our gain as a company will impact how we want to treat our workers. If
        progress drops we will have to admit we over-hired.

        Our current work environment is catered to bringing all our workers back to in-person office cubical! Our plan
        in the future is to add a ball pit and rockwall to engage our employees at the office!
