        <strong>Q3: What about the company's future, and how will they better treat workers?</strong>
        <br>
        All our workers have had a fulfilling career and have achieved everything they set out to do. Our gain as a
        company will impact how we want to treat our workers. If progress drops, we over hired and have to layoff.

        We have an environment that will make you forget what being outside is like, because we have a ball pit and
